## Html
To start, make a file with the name "index.html". The ".html" part is very important. Now, type in some plain text, like this:
    
    Hello World!

You should see the message when you open the file in your browser.
If you want to make something a main header, type this between your message:

    <h1> Hello World! </h1>

Now, your message should be bold and bigger than last time. This is because you made a <b>tag</b>. A tag is what has surrounded your message in the text (containing "<" and ">"). If you want your message to just be bold, type this:

    <b> Hello World! </b> 

In fact, here are all the other styling tags:

    <i> Hello World! </i> 
That makes your message look like this: <i>Italic</i>

    <u> Hello World! </u> 
That makes your message look like this: <u>Underline</u>

    <s> Hello World! </s> 
That makes your message look like this: <s>Strikethrough</s>

Going back to the header tags, you can use header tags so small, they go to the h6 tag. Here is a hierarchy of all the different header tags.

<h1>First Header</h1>
<h2>Second Header</h2>
<h3>Third Header</h3>
<h4>Fourth Header</h4>
<h5>Fifth Header</h5>
<h6>Sixth Header!</h6>

If you can't guess, here is how I did it:

    <h1> First Header </h1>
    <h2> Second Header </h2>
    <h3> Third Header </h3>
    <h4> Fourth Header </h4>
    <h5> Fifth Header </h5>
    <h6> Sixth Header! </h6>
