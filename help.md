## Html
To start, make a file with the name "index.html". The ".html" part is very important. Now, type in some plain text, like this:
    
    Hello World!

You should see the message when you open the file in your browser.
If you want to make something a main header, type this between your message:

    <h1> Hello World! </h1>

Now, your message should be bold and bigger than last time. This is because you made a <b>tag</b>. A tag is what has surrounded your message in the text (containing "<" and ">"). If you want your message to just be bold, type this:

    <b> Hello World! </b> 

In fact, here are all the other styling tags:

    <i> Hello World! </i> 
That makes your message look like this: <i>Italic</i>

    <u> Hello World! </u> 
That makes your message look like this: <u>Underline</u>

    <s> Hello World! </s> 
That makes your message look like this: <s>Strikethrough</s>

Going back to the header tags, you can use header tags so small, they go to the h6 tag. Here is a list of all the different header tags.

# First Header
## Second Header
### Third Header
#### Fourth Header
##### Fifth Header
###### Sixth Header!

If you can't guess, here is how I did it:

    <h1> First Header </h1>
    <h2> Second Header </h2>
    <h3> Third Header </h3>
    <h4> Fourth Header </h4>
    <h5> Fifth Header </h5>
    <h6> Sixth Header! </h6>

Now, you can start making your first website. Make a folder called 'My Website'. Put it on your Desktop to access it easily. Make a file in there called 'index.html' (again). Download Vscode (Visual Studio Code) if you want to make this tutorial easier to copy (and to actually follow along). 
So, to make a template, you should type '!' and hit enter. A bunch of code will appear where you put the exclamation mark. Here is what you should see:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
    </html>

You can indent everything between '<head>' and '</body>' just to make everything more organized. After that, you can setup your title.
